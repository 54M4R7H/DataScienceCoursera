<h3>Introduction</h3>
Part of the module <b>Reproducible Research</b> are 2 Project assignments: 

<li><b><a href="#Project1">Project 1</a></b>: Activity Monitoring Analysis
<li><b><a href="#Project2">Project 2</a></b>: Storm Data Analysis


<h3><a name = "Project1">Project 1 - Activity Monitoring Analysis</a></h3>

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as 
a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the “quantified self ” movement – a group of 
enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, 
or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under - utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and 
there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

Dataset:       [Activity Monitoring Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52kB] 

The variables included in this dataset are:  
<ul>
<li><b>steps:</b> Number of steps taking in a 5 - minute interval(missing values are coded as NA)
<li><b>date:</b> The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY - MM - DD format
<li><b>interval:</b> Identifier for the 5 - minute interval in which measurement was taken
</ul>

<h3><a name = "Project1">Project 2 - Storm Data Analysis</a></h3>

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and 
municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such 
outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.
This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. 
This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and 
where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.
